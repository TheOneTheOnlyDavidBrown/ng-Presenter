ng-Presenter
============

AngularJS based presentation app.

Allows for users to insert/edit/delete/rearrange slides with a clean interface. Uses TinyMCE to allow WYSIWYG editing. Works as a directive but the supporting files allow it to function properly. Currently slides are saved with localstorage.
